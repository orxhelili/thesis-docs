  ESNs employ artificial recurrent neural networks in a way that has recently been proposed 
  independently as a learning mechanism in biological brains. The learning method is computationally 
  efficient and easy to use. On a benchmark task of predicting a chaotic time series, accuracy is 
  improved by a factor of 2400 over previous techniques. The potential for engineering applications is 
  illustrated by equalizing a communication channel, where the signal error rate is improved by two orders 
  of magnitude.},
